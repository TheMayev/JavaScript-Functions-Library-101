# JavaScript functions 

This repository is made of functions ** I wrote **[^1] during my JavaScript learning process. 

## How to use: 

- separated_functions : this is folder which stores all functions in separated
files with some examples on what the output will look like. 

- all_functions.js : this is one single file with all functions, no examples 
just functions with short descriptions. 

** IMPORTANT ** 

You can use it in way you like. You can rewrite functions, copy it and use 
wherever you want. 

##  Origin of this repository: 

During my learning process it was difficult to just remeber all things I learned.
So I organize functions I wrote and prepare small library of them. 

The main reason for this repo is to have all my materials in one place and 
in organized fashion. 

But be my guest! Help yourself with this functions! :smile:
